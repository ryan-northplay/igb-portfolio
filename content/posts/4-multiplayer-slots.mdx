Own project to make any supplier's slotmachine into a multiplayer variant. By syncing game results between players, creating true social gameplay with existing games. 

This makes for great promotional tool for a supplier, with extra configurable bonuses.

The project is currently not in production while awaiting to make a deal with a popular game supplier.
